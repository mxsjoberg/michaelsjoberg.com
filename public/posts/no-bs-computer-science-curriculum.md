## <a name="1" class="anchor"></a> Introduction

This is an evolving list with learning material and recommended programming languages for computer science students. It works well on its own (for self-learners) or on top of undergraduate degree in computer science (or related field). The goal is to provide a solid foundation to build upon, degree or no degree, and will be updated whenever there is something missing, incorrect, or to add update learning materials (to keep it up-to-date).

If you are interested in computer science and engineering (and have plenty of spare time), see [github.com/michaelsjoeberg/the-ultimate-computer-science-and-engineering-curriculum](https://github.com/michaelsjoeberg/the-ultimate-computer-science-and-engineering-curriculum).

## <a name="2" class="anchor"></a> Programming

In this section: [Foundation](#2.1), [Paradigm exposure](#2.2), [Machine learning](#2.3), ["Modern" languages](#2.4)

Programming is the most important skill in computer science and computational problem solving, and should be the primary focus of any computer science curriculum (with use cases in computer systems, application software development, theorem proving, and so on).

If you prefer to work on projects while learning, see [github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning](https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning).

### <a name="2.1" class="anchor"></a> Foundation

The goal is to get comfortable with programming and to understand the software abstraction model (via Python, C, and Assembly; high-level to low-level, with Python representing the highest-level of abstraction). You most likely don't need to be fluent in any Assembly language (they are mostly compilation targets), but to be able to read and find errors in assembly generated by smaller programs is probably a good idea.

***Python***

- Get proficient or fluent (it's a very powerful programming language with a lot of support, look at some numerical libraries as well, especially NumPy)

- Try to implement an interpreter; see [Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)

- **Bonus:** Try to implement game of life; see [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners #2: Game of Life](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/).

***C***

- Learn basics of memory allocation and pointers; try to understand the assembly code generated for smaller programs (gcc -S option)

- Get familiar with C++ (could also get proficient or fluent if appropriate, it's a very powerful programming language)

***Assembly***

- x86, ARM (could also explore other architectures if more appropriate); see [x86 Assembly Guide](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) and [ARM Hardware and Assembly Language](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/courses/cs301/2014-fall/notes/arm-asm/)

- Get familiar with registers; see [x86 Assembly/X86 Architecture](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture)

Recommended learning material: [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-OHallaron-Randal-Bryant/dp/1292101768), [The Art of Assembly Language](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Assembly-Language-2nd/dp/1593272073), [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628), [A Tour of C++](https://www.amazon.com/Tour-2nd-Depth-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832), [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280).

### <a name="2.2" class="anchor"></a> Paradigm exposure

The goal is to get familiar with a range of programming paradigms, understand parts of the hardware abstraction model (via Verilog), and become a more confident computer programmer in general. A few notes on programming languages: Python and C (and C++) are considered multi-paradigm (as in supporting more than one style), and more specifically: imperative and structured.

***Haskell***

- Functional

***Prolog***

- Declarative and probably most popular logic-based programming language

- **Bonus:** Get familiar with Coq (one of the most popular theorem provers); see [Coq in a Hurry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0603118.pdf)

***Verilog***

- Hardware description language; probably most popular language to design and verify digital systems

- **Bonus:** Try to implement designs at different abstraction levels (gate-level, register-transfer-level, behavioural-level); see [Verilog Tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/verilog)

Recommended learning material: [Thinking Functionally with Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Functionally-Haskell-Richard-Bird/dp/1107452643), [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686), [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871).

What about object-oriented programming? "*[at] big companies, software tends to be written by large (and frequently changing) teams of mediocre programmers. Object-oriented programming imposes a discipline on these programmers that prevents any one of them from doing too much damage*", read this post by Paul Graham (Viaweb, Y Combinator): [Why Arc Isn't Especially Object-Oriented](http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html).

### <a name="2.3" class="anchor"></a> Machine learning

The goal is to get exposed to machine learning and the idea that output is based on data instead of design, watch this talk by Andrej Karpathy (Director of AI at Tesla): [Building the Software 2.0 Stack](https://databricks.com/session/keynote-from-tesla).

***Neural Networks*** (Python)

- Get familiar with Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow (or any other similar framework if more appropriate)

- **Bonus:** Try to build a neural network from scratch; see [How to build your own Neural Network from scratch in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6)

Recommended learning material: [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Page-Machine-Learning-Book/dp/199957950X).

### <a name="2.4" class="anchor"></a> "Modern" languages

The above topics provides familiarity with different paradigms and modern developments (such as ML). Below are few more programming languages to consider, somewhat based on the "most loved" programming languages: [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted).
	
***Rust*** (backed by Mozilla)

- Natural transition from C++, could also explore Scala if more familiar with Java

- **Bonus:** Try to build an operating system; see [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/)

***Clojure***
 
- Lisp-like, could also explore Lisp if more appropriate

***Nim***

- Python-like but compiled, could also explore Lua if interested in embedded applications (or game development)

***Kotlin***

- Probably most popular language for Android development (see [Kotlin is now Google's preferred language for Android app development](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/kotlin-is-now-googles-preferred-language-for-android-app-development)), compiles to JVM and JavaScript (could also explore JavaScript if more appropriate)

***Go*** (backed by Google)

- Memory safe C (if you don't like Rust, could also explore Dart)

## <a name="3" class="anchor"></a> Mathematics

In this section: [Basics](#3.1), [General topics](#3.2)

Mathematics has a central role in any computer science curriculum and a solid foundation in selected mathematical topics can be highly valuable, especially in more advanced computing tasks (not to mention ML).

### <a name="3.1" class="anchor"></a> Basics

The Goal is to get familiar with data structures and theory of computation, these topics could also be covered in recommended learning material for some programming languages.
